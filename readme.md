# Blackbody Spectra Summing

A few scripts written to begin to gauge the feasibility of building a blackbody thermometer for ultrafast, nanoscale temperature measurements.

## The problem

Among the many possible challenges includes the conflation of multiple blackbody temperatures across space.  This repository contains scripts to (1) crudely plot the temperature distribution of an irradiated sample and (2) sum the blackbody spectra of the individual temperatures to compare with the total blackbody spectrum and gauge distinctiveness given temperature range and thermal distribution.

## What we know

Lab work has shown thus far that

- CB + CW (60 W) 808 nm laser irradiation has only achieved a maximum temperature of ~800 K
  
- pulsed (50 mJ) 1064 nm laser irradiation has achieved likely > 1000 K based on kinetic calculations, though likely if at all, only for durations on nanosecond timescales

## Current script findings

THEY'RE LOOKING PRETTY SIMILAR.  Hopefully that will be mitigated with a homogenized thermal distribution.

### to-do

- [ ] plot how the blackbody spectra vs summed spectra distinctiveness changes with temperature range and thermal distribution
  
- [ ] record existing detector wavelengths, window sizes, and detectivities, to find what temperatures, emissivities, etc. would be necessary

- [ ] make sure the overflow runtime warning from running the summation script is not critical

- [ ] optimize spectra summing script (it's radially symmetric, no need to calculate the same values multiple times... or do I?  would there be more outside points?  I need to sleep)

## Future considerations

Additional challenges include

- **Conflation across time** - since substantial cooling can occur for certain systems (e.g., pulsed lasers, MNPs, liquid solvent) at or below the nanosecond timescale, control over the measurement's time-resolution must be achieved through optics, the detector, or digitally
  
- **"exposure-triangle" problems** - getting strong enough signal with enough points to ensure high SNR and at spacing that optimizes fit accuracy (ideally enclosing the peak), especially considering the time constraint
  
- **Designing optics** - sensing optics need to focus to a small area, well-aligned with beam such that the thermal distribution is as homogenous as possible.  Moreover, beyond being able to withstand potentially the high powers of beam exposure needed to produce these temperatures, the optics may need to interface with a bulky air-free chamber
